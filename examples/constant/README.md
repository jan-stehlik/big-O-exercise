## O(1) Constant time complexity

Constant runtime complexity is the best scaling complexity you can aim for.

Constant time means that performance of an algorithm is not impacted by the size of an input.

For example if it takes 100ms to perform a task for input size of 10, it will take 100ms for any other input size.
